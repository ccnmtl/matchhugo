<form method="post" action="."><div class="pageblock"><h3>Treatment for Kenyatta</h3><div class="maintext">
<p>You concur with the decision to start Kenyatta on an antibiotic and analgesic and agree to see her in your office for follow up care. The hospital billing office identifies the family as Medicaid-eligible and arranges for the family to enroll.</p>
<p>At the first visit to your office, you meet Kenyatta's family and learn that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Kenyatta is under the legal care of her grandmother, Joyce</li>
<li>Her mother passed away two years ago and her
father is absent from the family</li>
<li>She does not currently have a dentist because the family has a) no dental insurance, b) cannot find a dentist close to home, and c) there is nobody to watch the baby, Sean</li>
</ol>
