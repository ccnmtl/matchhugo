<div class="pullquote"><p>Social workers draw upon their knowledge of human development and behavior, and social, economic, and cultural institutions and systems. They seek to improve situations that affect people’s abilities to accomplish life tasks, realize aspirations and values. They seek to alleviate distress which impacts health and wellbeing. Social workers employ a strengths-based perspective to assess clients' inherent capacities and work with individuals and groups to build upon these qualities.</p>
