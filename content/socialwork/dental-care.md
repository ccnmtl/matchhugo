<form method="post" action="."><div class="pageblock"><h3>Dental care for Kenyatta & baby Sean</h3><div class="maintext">
<div class="right">{{< figure src="/img/assets/joyce-sean1-small.jpg" alt="" class="" name="" usemap="">}}</div>
<p>As Joyce is giving you the rest of Kenyatta’s history, the baby begins to cry. Joyce pulls out a bottle of pink milk which immediately quiets him. Kenyatta objects, telling her mother that she doesn't want her baby to have strawberry-flavored drinks. You notice that Sean appears to have ECC. You ask if Sean has seen a dentist. Kenyatta is surprised by your question, saying that he has not yet lost his baby teeth.</p>
<p>Joyce signs consent for Kenyatta’s treatment and you treat her immediate problem.</p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
