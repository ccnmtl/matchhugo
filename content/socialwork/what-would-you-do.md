</div><div class="pageblock"><h3>Kenyatta</h3><div class="maintext"><p>You are on staff at your local hospital and receive a call from the ER physician asking about 16 year old Kenyatta who is complaining of jaw pain.</p>
<p>The ER doc reports that there are a number of obvious cavities and there is an abscess on a lower right molar.</p>
<p>Kenyatta reported that when eating popcorn at the movies a while ago, the filling on tooth #30 broke. She thought nothing of it at the time, but now she has throbbing pain and a bad taste in her mouth.</p></div>
