<div class="pageblock"><h3>Examining Emma</h3><div class="maintext"><p>On history, Emma reports that her teeth have been sensitive to cold liquids lately.</p>
<p>On examination, you note enamel erosion on the lingual aspects of the maxillary incisors. You suspect an eating disorder, but are not sure how to bring it up with Emma or if you should speak with her family.</p></div>

<div class="seven-ways"><h3>Early Intervention and Education</h3>
<div class="maintext"><p>While pediatric dentists typically think of early intervention as caries-prevention for infants and toddlers, the concept also applies to conditions that develop later in a child's development like anorexia and bulimia. In consultation with a social worker, you can develop an integrated course of action on how to approach Emma and her family to discuss your concerns. Many social workers specialize in issues of child and adolescent behavior.</p></div></div>
