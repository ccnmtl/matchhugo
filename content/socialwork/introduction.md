<div class="pageblock"><div class="maintext"><p>While medicine has a long history of collaboration with other professionals, pediatric dentists are only beginning to partner with non-dental professionals. Some pediatric dentists already engage social workers in their practices. </p>
<p>Social workers interfaces with children and families in settings where pediatric dentists usually don’t, including schools, hospitals, clinics, community programs (like Head Start and Early Intervention Programs), service agencies, and private practices.</p>
<p>Social workers can help you understand and leverage community and family issues that influence pediatric oral health. The diagram below shows some of ways social workers can help: "social environment," "social capital," "culture," and "health behaviors, practices, & coping skills of families.”</p>
