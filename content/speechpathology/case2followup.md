Evaluation may be needed if more than half of a three-year-old childâ€™s speech is not understood outside of the family circle.</p>
<p>Speech sound development is not fully contingent upon adequate range of motion of the articulators. In this case, even if the frenectomy is performed for speech sounds, he still is not using his anatomy to correctly produce these target phonemes and a SLP referral is warranted.</p>
