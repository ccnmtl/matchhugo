</div><div class="pageblock"><p>Optimal patient care results from interdisciplinary treatment. Pediatric dentists not only assess and manage oral health and structure, but follow a childâ€™s oral function and the growth and development of their teeth and oral cavity. Aberrant oral structure and function can result in difficulty with speech and swallowing.</p>
<p>Pediatric dentists have regular contact with their patients and their caregivers. Because of this relationship and expertise in oral structure and function, they may be the first pediatric specialist to discover that a child has a communication disorder or swallowing disorder. Therefore, it is important that pediatric dentists understand how collaboration with a speech-language pathologist can benefit the health and development of their patients.</p>
<p>Speech-language pathologists (SLPs) help facilitate optimal patient care by improving and treating your patients':</p>

<li>Speech production</li>
<li>Language skills</li>
<li>Oral function</li>
<li>Behaviors that impact compliance, oral structure and development</li>
