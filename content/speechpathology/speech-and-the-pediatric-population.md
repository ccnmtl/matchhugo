                    <p>D is correct. The “s” and “r” sounds are not typically developed until 3-5 years of age.  At 2 years of age, the quantity of words versus the quality of the speech is important. The first sounds that develop are produced more anteriorly in the oral cavity (e.g. with the lips and the tongue tip) and are visible. It is hard to see a person place their tongue correctly for sounds like “s” and “r.”</p>
