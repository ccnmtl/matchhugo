<dd>Deficits in the information processing of audible signals not attributed to impaired peripheral hearing sensitivity or intellectual impairment</dd>
<dt>Childhood Apraxia of Speech (CAS)</dt>
<dd>Difficulty planning and sequencing the movements required for speech, and difficulty with prosody</dd>

<dt>Hyponasal</dt>
<dd>A resonance disorder when air is blocked from the nasal cavity during speech due to a blockage; mostly perceptible on nasal sounds (m, n, ng)</dd>
<dt>Intelligibility </dt>
<dd>Refers to the proportion of a speaker's output that a listener can readily understand</dd>
