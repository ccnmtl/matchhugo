<form method="post" action="."><div class="pageblock"><h3>Maya’s first visit</h3><p>When Maya turns 3 years old she comes in for her first routine dental visit. She enters the examination room smiling and says,"Hi dentist! See my new red boots and my new baby!" During the examination, she is highly compliant and asks some questions about your equipment.</p>
<p>Taking her patient history reveals that she uses either her bottle or a pacifier before bed. Her mother has been unable to wean her since the recent addition of a newborn to the family. Her examination reveals normal eruption of primary dentition and a 4 mm open bite. You see that she is protruding her tongue past her lips while talking. Additionally, this seems to have an impact on how well you understand her and is quite noticeable since she is talkative for her age. You speak to Maya’s mother about the importance of weaning Maya from the bottle and pacifier.</p>
