<div class="pageblock"><p>By focusing on oral health education and disease prevention, the CDHC can empower people
 in underserved communities to manage their own oral health. When disease requires treatment, the CDHC can link patients with dentists who can provide that treatment, and can help obtain other services —such as child care or transportation — that patients may
 need in order to receive care. </p>
<p>With the pilot program completed, the ADA has conducted a comprehensive evaluation of both
 the individual CDHCs’ effectiveness and the degree to which they are helping increase access to dental care in their communities. That evaluation has shown that CDHCs are meeting and exceeding expectations. As part of the Action for Dental Health: Dentists
 Making a Difference campaign, the ADA now is working to engage leaders in education and public health, as well as the private practice community in bringing CDHCs to dentally underserved communities nationwide.</p>
<p>Watch this video to learn more about how CDHCs have a direct impact on the oral health care of the communities they serve.</p>
