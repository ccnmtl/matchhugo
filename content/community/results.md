<div class="pageblock"><h3>Summary</h3><p>Findings demonstrate that the addition of the CDHC has aided in improving access to dental care among preschool children in the community through patient navigation and coordination of care. Over a ten month period, 5831 children were served in the elementary schools for a total of 1,023 school visits over 69 days. Four hundred one of those 583 <sup>1</sup> children went on to receive comprehensive dental care in the dental clinic; 234 of those had not been seen at the dental clinic prior to being seen at school. Typically, these children came to the clinic 90 <sup>2</sup> days after screening. The total care value of services provided to the children seen in the elementary schools and brought into the dental clinic through elementary school
outreach was $602,862. Outreach services alone amounted to $373,880 of care, while $228,982 of care was provided at the dental clinic during that ten-month period.</p>

<sup>5</sup> For the purposes of this report, a “new patient” is defined as a child who did not have record of a dental appointment in the dental clinic prior to receiving dental services at the elementary school; this definition is based on the time period from August 2010 to March 2012 for which appointment data was collected.
