<div class="pageblock"><p>Dental and medical data were extracted from the health center’s patient management system. The current analysis focuses on dental patient encounters with pediatric patients (ages 1 to 17) occurring between May 31, 2011 and May 31, 2013. The CDHC began pediatric intervention in June 2012. The current analysis compares the pre-CDHC period (May 31, 2011 - May 31, 2012) to the post-CDHC period (June 1, 2012 - May 31, 2013). Chi-square tests (Χ<sup>2</sup>) and t-tests (t) were conducted to compare the differences between the pre-CDHC and post-CDHC periods.</p>
