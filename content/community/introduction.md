<div class="pageblock"><h4>Community Health</h4>
<p>Working at the community level to promote healthy living and the prevention of chronic disease brings the greatest health benefits to the largest number of people in need.  The focus of community health is to optimize the health and quality of life of all persons who live, work or are otherwise active in a defined community by utilizing culturally appropriate methods.  Community health programs pay special attention to the intersection of the community’s needs, the community’s understanding of and priorities for health, the best methods for documenting the evidence gathered from practice in the community, as well as the science of community health. A community approach to promoting healthy living can have broader effects than the efforts of people working on their own to make lifestyle changes. </p>
<h4>Community Health Workers</h4>
<p>Community Health Workers (CHWs) are frontline public health workers who have a direct understanding of the community that they serve.  They may be members of the community they serve which provides a unique perspective into the lifestyle and treatment needs of the community.  This trusting relationship enables CHWs to serve as a link between health and social services with the community.  Their connection with the community facilitates access to services as well as improves the quality and cultural competence with which services are provided.  According to the American Public Health Association, CHWs also build individual and community capacity by increasing health knowledge and self-sufficiency through a range of activities such as outreach, community education, informal counseling, social support and advocacy.</p>
<p>Community dental health coordinators (CDHCs) are community health workers who have received additional dental training and function as part of the dental team.  The primary focus of the CDHC is to reduce the incidence of oral health disparities in underserved populations by improving access to dental care and by targeting the causes of oral disease.   </p>
