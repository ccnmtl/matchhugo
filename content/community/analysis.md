<div class="pageblock"><p>Descriptive statistics were computed to reflect dental services provided in the elementary schools versus dental services provided in the dental clinic. These statistics include frequencies for dates of service, types of services provided, days between screening and comprehensive care, and proportions of missed
and cancelled appointments.</p>
<p>Any given patient may have received dental care on multiple occasions and during each visit may have received multiple services. Therefore, other analyses were conducted at the patient level and at the visit level. At the patient level, averages were computed for total value of care, value of care per visit, number of visits, and total number of services provided. At the visit level, averages were computed for total value of care and number of services provided during a visit. </p>
<p>Additional analyses were conducted to describe those children who received comprehensive care in the dental clinic only after they had been seen at elementary school.</p>
