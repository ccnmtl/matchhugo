<p>To date, CDHCs have been particularly helpful in addressing the oral health needs of children by routinely participating in school-based outreach programs focused on oral health education, dental screenings and providing other preventive services such as prophylaxis, fluoride varnishes and dental sealants as appropriate. The CDHC’s training enhances their ability to communicate effectively with patients from different age groups, literacy levels and cultural backgrounds.   </p>
<h4>How might their work cross over with other health fields?</h4>
<p>CDHCs can be valuable partners with medical and allied health professionals, as the entire health care team focuses on the overall health of vulnerable patient populations. Their  ability to solicit detailed health histories and to address many of the social determinants of health with information, education, access to resources and assistance with patient navigation – all in an easily understandable, age-appropriate and culturally sensitive manner -- can be particularly helpful with a variety of  patients exhibiting multiple health care needs. </p>
