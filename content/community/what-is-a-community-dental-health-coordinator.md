They promote health by providing education, leadership, as well as preventative services to support underserved communities.  They are typically members of the community where they serve and are trained to integrate information about oral health and overall health into the community’s own language, culture and value system, thus reducing many of the barriers to health services.</p>
<h4>Educational background</h4>
<p>The didactic training for CDHCs may be offered online and is supplemented with in-person clinical instruction/assessments.  Upon successful completion of the didactic training, CDHC trainees complete an internship in a community setting where dental and health promotion is translated  into practice.  The duration of the program is based on a number of factors (e.g. the trainees’ past education and/or experience) and is determined by the educational institution, with the time varying between 4 and 18 months of instructional time. </p>
