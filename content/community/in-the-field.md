<div class="pageblock"><p>Below are some samples of proven results of CDHCs working in the field from the September 2013 Final Report:</p>
<ul>
<li>CDHCs provided services to 114 dental patients in a rural tribal community health center’s diabetes clinic. During its time at the clinic the missed appointment rate for dental patients in the diabetes clinic dropped to zero, compared with a clinic-wide rate of 18 percent.</li>
<li>CDHCs worked at an Indian Health Service clinic, providing services valued at more than $105,000 to 240 children at Head Start and daycare centers over a 10-month period.</li>
<li>CDHCs worked in a single-dentist practice in a remote, rural location and nearly doubled the practice’s productivity over the prior year.</li>
</ul>
