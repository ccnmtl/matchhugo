Congenital heart defects (CHD) place children at risk for:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Bacterial endocarditis:</strong> Dental procedures that involve disruption of the gingival tissue or oral mucosa may develop oral bacteremia.  </li>
<li><strong>Bleeding risk:</strong>  Children on anticoagulation therapies post surgical intervention are at risk for bleeding.  </li>
<li><strong>Dental caries:</strong>  Many patients with CHD take sucrose-containing medications several times daily.</li>
<li><strong>Xerostomia:</strong>  Certain cardiac medications (diuretics, ACE inhibitors) may cause and increased risk. </li>
<li><strong>Malocclusion:</strong>  Children with CHD have a higher incidence of malocclusion (mesiocclusion and distocclusion).</li>
</ol>
<h3>Alleviating Measures</h3>
<ul>
<li>Obtain a thorough medical and dental history at each visit</li>
<li>Consult with patients pediatric and/or cardiology provider to determine if antibiotic prophylaxis therapy is indicated or anticoagulant therapy should be paused</li>
<li>Refer to the American Heart Association Guidelines on Antibiotic Prophylaxis (AHA, 2008)</li>
<li>Rinse mouth with water and spit after taking liquid medications</li>
<li>Chew sugar-free gum to stimulate salivary flow and restore moisture</li>
<li>Use caries preventive measures (sealants, fluoride supplements, antimicrobial mouthwashes)</li>
<li>Screen for significant crowding, abnormal dentition development, premature tooth loss and refer for orthodontia as indicated</li>
</ul>
