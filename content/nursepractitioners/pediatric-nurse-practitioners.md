NPs are licensed as independent health care practitioners within a specified population. They practice autonomously and in collaboration with other health care professionals to assess, diagnose, treat and manage patients’ acute and chronic health care problems. NPs emphasize health promotion and disease prevention and are committed to quality health care and clinical outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Pediatric nurse practitioners (PNPs)</strong> have advanced education in pediatric nursing and health care and serve children and families in a variety of health care settings. They care for the pediatric population in either a primary care or acute care role providing individualized quality health care to well and sick infants, children and adolescents.</p>
</div><div class="pageblock"><h2>Education, Licensing and Certification Requirements</h2>
PNPs have met the following academic and professional requirements:
<h3>Academic Degree</h3>
<p>Currently, academic preparation of PNPs is completion of an accredited graduate-level education program or post-graduate certificate (either post-master’s or post-doctoral) in either the primary care role or the acute care role. The National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners (NAPNAP), the professional association for PNPs, supports movement of the current level of preparation necessary for advanced nursing practice to a Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP).</p>
<h3>Role Focus: Primary Care or Acute Care</h3>
<p><strong>Primary Care Pediatric Nurse Practitioners (PNP-PC)</strong> provide primary care to children from birth through young adult including well child care and prevention/management of common pediatric acute illnesses and chronic conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Acute Care Pediatric Nurse Practitioners (PNP-AC)</strong> provide specialized care to meet the physiologic and psychological needs of infants, children and young adults with complex acute and chronic health conditions. </p>
<h3>National Certification Exam</h3>
<p>Most states require individuals to sit for a certification examination to assess national competencies for regulatory purposes. PNPs can be certified in the primary care and/or acute care role. Annual assessments of competency in the PNP role is required to maintain certification and may involve a combination of continuing education, clinical practice hours and academic credits.</p>
