<div class="pageblock"><p>In this case Justin’s PNP contacts Dr. Jacob very shortly after Justin’s visit. As stated earlier, Ms. Phillips is looking for guidance as to how he can best meet the oral health care needs of this client. Dr. Jacob is appreciative of the consultation and follow up from the PNP to discuss Justin’s case. Further discussion ensues regarding Justin’s fractured teeth, lack of dental follow up, need for preventive dental visits, and possible sedation during office visits.  </p>
