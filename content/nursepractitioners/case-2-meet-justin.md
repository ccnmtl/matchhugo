He is accompanied by his mother who has been his primary caregiver since birth.  He has just begun receiving routine health maintenance and health supervision at a new pediatric primary care practice. Mother reports that he is also followed by a neurologist, orthopedist, physical therapist, occupational therapist, speech-language pathologist and a nutritionist, although his care has been inconsistent.</p>
<p>His pediatric nurse practitioner, Tina Phillips, MS, PNP-PC has referred him and his mother to Dr. Jacobâ€™s dental practice because they have not received consistent dental care.  The pediatric nurse practitioner is also looking for guidance as to how she can best meet the oral health care needs of this client.</p>
