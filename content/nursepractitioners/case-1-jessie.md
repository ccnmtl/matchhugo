She receives routine health maintenance and health supervision at the local health center from a pediatric nurse practitioner, Janet Wilson, MS, CPNP-PC.  She has been followed in this clinic since birth. The mother’s pregnancy was uncomplicated and she received adequate prenatal care. She is in Dr. Brown’s pediatric dental office today because she was referred by her pediatric nurse practitioner (PNP) for her first dental exam after receiving fluoride varnish at her last visit to the health clinic. </p>
