<div class="pageblock"><p>Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic condition affecting metabolism of fats, carbohydrates and proteins. Two basic types are:  insulin-dependent (IDDM; Type 1) and non-insulin-dependent (NIDDM; Type II)*. Both types affect children. Poor glycemic control (HbA1c > 8) is associated microangiopathy and salivary hypofunction and can lead to the following conditions:</p>
</div><div class="pageblock did_you_know"><h3>Did you know?</h3><p>Type II diabetes occurs when the body develops resistance insulin and no longer uses it effectively. Once referred to as adult-onset diabetes, type II diabetes is occurring in children and adolescents with increasing frequency over the last two decades.</p>

<li><strong>Periodontal disease:</strong> Reduction in salivary flow; dehydration of alveolar mucosa from mouth breathing; decrease in bone mineral density</li>
<li><strong>Impaired wound healing</strong></li>
<li><strong>Oral candidiasis:</strong> Immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory effects of steroids; higher salivary glucose promoting fungal overgrowth</li>
<li><strong>Xerostomia:</strong>  Certain cardiac medications (diuretics, ACE inhibitors) may cause and increased risk. </li>
<li><strong>Dental caries:</strong> Reduced salivary flow rate and pH; presence of fermentable carbohydrates; reduction in buffering capacity</li>
</ol>
<h3>Alleviating Measures</h3>
<ul>
<li>Review recent diabetes control with patient/caregiver and caregiver and consult with patientâ€™s pediatric and/or endocrinology provider as indicated and always before a surgical intervention</li>
<li>Instruct child to eat and to adhere to usual medication regime prior to examinations</li>
<li>Monitor nutrition, oral hygiene and suggest modifications as indicated</li>
<li>Chew sugar-free gum to stimulate salivary flow and restore moisture</li>
<li>Use caries preventive measures (sealants, fluoride supplements, antimicrobial mouthwashes)</li>
<li>Aggressively treat periodontal disease and oral candidiasis </li>
<li>Consider antibiotic prophylaxis for children with poor glycemic control in consultation with pediatric and/or endocrinology provider</li>
<li>Screen for tobacco use and provide prevention and cessation counseling</li>
<li>Monitor for signs of hypoglycemia during examinations and procedures and intervene as necessary</li>
</ul>
