<div class="pageblock"><p>All of these red flags are also potential areas for collaboration and/or mutual promotion of anticipatory guidance with a PNP. Review each area of concern and see some things that could be addressed for each.</p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-success">green= oral health issues</div>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-warning">yellow= anticipatory guidance</div>
<h3>Abuse/Neglect</h3>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-success">Children who are being abused or neglected frequently are first identified by dentists because more than 50% of cases of child abuse or neglect involve the head, the face, and the neck and particularly the oral cavity.</div>
<p>Children with developmental disabilities are at increased risk for child abuse and neglect. Signs of physical abuse often manifest in oral trauma. Key signs in Justin’s case that should raise a suspicion of child abuse include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inconsistent medical/dental care and frequent change in providers</li>
<li>Loosened/fractured teeth </li>
<li>Frenulum injury/laceration </li>
</ul>
<p>Findings of oral trauma such as these may indicate that Justin is being maltreated. Accidental injuries of the mouth are common. Differentiating accidental injuries from abuse requires a careful health history from the child’s caregiver to determine whether the injuries are consistent history provided and the child’s physical and developmental abilities. Reporting of suspected child abuse or neglect is mandatory when a health care provider has concern a child is being victimized. In cases where there is uncertainty of abuse or no immediate concern, consultation with Justin’s pediatric nurse practitioner would be appropriate. All findings/explanations should be carefully documented in the patient’s health record. </p>
<h3>Diet</h3>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-success">Diet plays an important role in caries promotion and prevention.</div>
<p>Children with cerebral palsy are at increased risk for dental caries and have an increased risk of enamel hypoplasia. Limit Justin’s use of sugary snacks. Encourage fruits and vegetables with dips to facilitate swallowing. Suggestions include peanut butter, mild salsa, yogurt-based dips, fruit and yogurt, homemade bean dip, and dressings. Referral to a nutritionist for dietary assessment and recommendations may be indicated. </p>
<p>Chewing course foods assists in cleaning teeth and stimulating gum tissue.  Soft diets may promote development of caries. Encourage Justin to brush his teeth twice daily with a soft toothbrush and toothpaste with fluoride. Referral to a nutritionist for dietary assessment and recommendations may be indicated. </p>
<h3>Physical Therapy</h3>
<p>There is nothing in the patient’s history or evaluation that warrants discussion of physical therapy at this time.</p>
<h3>Medications</h3>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-warning">The PNP and pediatric dentist can support each other’s practice and enhance patient care by coordinating and discussing prescribed medications.</div>
<p>Muscle relaxants and anticonvulsants can cause xerostomia. Encourage sugar-free gum, if Justin can tolerate, to stimulate saliva flow and restore moisture. Caries-preventive measures (sealants, fluoride supplements and antimicrobial mouthwashes) should be implemented.</p>
<h3>Mobility</h3>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-warning">Practitioners should provide appropriate injury prevention counseling for orofacial trauma.</div>
<p>Since Justin is at risk for falls, he is susceptible to dental trauma. The recommended protocol to follow with Justin should be reviewed with his parents and his pediatric nurse practitioner. </p>
<h3>Cognition</h3>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-warning">Often, children with special health care needs but normal intelligence are frequently mistaken for having intellectual disabilities.</div>
<p>Consulting with the PNP may be helpful in discovering which examination strategies have been successful in the past.   Try to keep staff consistent at each visit to promote trust.  Explain all procedures and follow-up instructions at levels appropriate for the child’s intellectual and developmental level.</p>
<h3>Bruxism/Tongue Thrust</h3>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-success">The pediatric dentist, being the primary caretaker for this issue, can encourage the PNP to reinforce the treatment plan.</div>
<p>Justin’s tongue thrust may cause malocclusion and impair swallowing of food.  Referral to an orthodontist for evaluation may be indicated.  Referral to a speech-language pathologist for retraining of muscles associated with swallowing may be indicated. Bruxism can result in fracturing, loosening, and/or loss of teeth.  Mouth guards, if tolerated, can decrease the adverse effects of bruxism. </p>
<h3>Immunizations</h3>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-warning">Pediatric dentists can reinforce age appropriate immunizations.</div>
<p>The PNP would recommend discussing the benefits of immunizations versus the risks from disease. Immunizations are an efficacious and cost-effective way to improve the overall health of children.</p>
<h3>Oral Hygiene</h3>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-success">Children with cerebral palsy, like all children, should have routine and consistent dental care.</div>
<p>Modifications to the routine dental exam may be indicated, including not forcing limbs into unnatural positions in the dental chair; using gentle but firm pressure to calm spasticity of limbs; treating children in their wheelchair if applicable; and minimizing use of bright lights and sudden movements that may stimulate reflexive movements and spasticity. Again, collaborative discussion with the PNP may help in indicated which treatment style works best for Justin. </p>
