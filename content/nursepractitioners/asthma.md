<div class="pageblock"><p>Asthma is a chronic inflammatory condition affecting more nearly 7 million children in the United States (CDC, 2012). Asthma constricts airways and causes inflammation, excess mucus production and breathing difficulties. Medications used to treat asthma include bronchodilators, corticosteroids and anticholinergics. These drugs as typically inhaled using nebulizers and inhalers and reduce airway inflammation and sensitivity to triggers. Oral health problems that result from these medications* and their causes include:</p>

Recently, many medications have become available in sugar-free varieties. These medications must be prescribed specifically by name as the generic forms of most medications still contain sugar.</p>
</div><div class="pageblock"><ol>
<li><strong>Dental caries:</strong> Reduced salivary flow rate and pH; presence of fermentable carbohydrates; reduction in buffering capacity</li>
<li><strong>Periodontal disease:</strong> Reduction in salivary flow; dehydration of alveolar mucosa from mouth breathing; decrease in bone mineral density</li>
<li><strong>Oral candidiasis:</strong> Immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory effects of steroids; higher salivary glucose promoting fungal overgrowth</li>
</ol>
</div><div class="pageblock"><h3>Alleviating Measures</h3>
<ul>
<li>Educate patients about increased susceptibility</li>
<li>Rinse mouth with water and spit after using inhaled corticosteroids and other medications</li>
<li>Attach a spacer to inhaler to deliver inhaled drugs directly to the airway</li>
<li>Chew sugar-free gum to stimulate salivary flow and restore moisture</li>
<li>Use caries preventive measures (sealants, fluoride supplements, antimicrobial mouthwashes)</li>
</ul>
