Pediatric dentists play a vital role in recognizing dietary risks for not only oral health, but also the overall health of their patients.</p>
<p>While medicine has a long history of collaboration with other professionals, pediatric dentists are only beginning to partner with non-dental professionals. Some pediatric dentists already engage registered dietitians in their practices.</p>
<p><strong>Registered dietitians can help save you time and resources by:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Managing your patient’s dietary risks, especially those with other medical conditions such as diabetes</li>
<li>Educating caregivers about their child’s overall nutritional needs</li>
</ul>
