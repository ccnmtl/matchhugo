<div class="pageblock"><p><span>The case you just completed may be very similar to situations you have come across in your own practice. Referring to a registered dietitian in this case provided Nick and his mother with additional time to review nutritional concerns impacting his dentition and overall health. </span></p>
<p><span>By building a referral base of registered dietitians you can now:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Cross refer patients</li>
<li>Have lunch-and-learns in your office on timely nutrition topics</li>
<li>Utilize a useful resource to develop nutrition educational material for your practice</li>
</ul>
